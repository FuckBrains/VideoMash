0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Mmm.. What happened? What are you thinking about?

1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:03,940
I ..

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,220
I wish to continue my practice after marriage

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:06,720
Cooking?

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,260
In that case you must start immediately

5
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,299
because our marriage is going to be soon.

6
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:10,799
It’s not that.

7
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:11,739
a clinic of my own

8
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:12,619
It’s my dream!

9
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:13,179
Practice?

10
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:13,920
But..

11
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,820
we are going to the States after our marriage

12
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,320
Yes..but..

13
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,220
Sister , they are asking for both of you downstairs.

14
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,771
We’ll be right there.

15
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:19,771
can’t we try at any hospitals over there?

16
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:20,271
Sandhya..

17
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,271
am earning enough for both of us to live comfortably..

18
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:22,771
and besides,

19
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:24,451
when I travel for my business purposes.

20
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:26,451
there should be someone at home

21
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:27,371
But Rahul..

22
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:28,211
my studies…

23
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:28,828
Moreover ..

24
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,828
if they hear your rant about wanting to work,

25
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:32,648
my mother and my relatives would laugh at me.

26
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:34,088
Sister, would you help me catch the balloon?

27
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:34,908
Hey , as I told you

28
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:35,948
Yea, I’ve liked her

29
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:36,507
Now..

30
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:38,507
rest will proceed according to my mom’s wishes.

31
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:40,207
Listen, shall I call you later?

32
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,087
I was speaking to Sandhya right now.

33
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:43,927
Both of you are wanted downstairs.

34
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:44,427
Aunty..

35
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:45,187
here’s  a joke!

36
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:48,927
Seems like Sandhya wants to start a clinic in America after the wedding

37
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:51,927
What is so funny, child?

38
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,347
Sandhya says she wants to work after marriage.

39
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,727
There is really no need.

40
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:58,587
You don’t have to work for a living.

41
00:00:58,587 --> 00:01:01,367
You just have to go there and enjoy your life, my child.

42
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,087
But aunty ..

43
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:04,187
..MBBS is hard earned..

44
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:05,807
You don’t have to work hard now

45
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:07,807
earns enough for both of you ..

46
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:09,247
and your future generations.

47
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:09,827
Besides,

48
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:12,387
if our relatives come to know that our daughter-in-law is working

49
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:14,587
they would laugh at us.

50
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:15,967
Listen Mr. Madhu..

51
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:18,267
There have been one-after-the other marriage proposals for him.

52
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:20,587
Everyone is just waiting to snatch him away.

53
00:01:20,587 --> 00:01:21,107
but he ,

54
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,527
wasn’t interested in any of them ,

55
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:25,347
until he saw Sandhya’s photograph.

56
00:01:25,347 --> 00:01:27,327
Does she cook?

57
00:01:27,327 --> 00:01:27,827
Yes,

58
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:29,047
she cooks well.

59
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,227
Great!

60
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:33,047
He just loves pineapple pullissery (curry).

61
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:35,007
But he doesn’t manage to get it made there in America.

62
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:35,962
And moreover,

63
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:36,802
its not like in here

64
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:41,562
servant there charges atleast 40000 rupees.

65
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:43,182
From now on,

66
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:44,582
it’s your responsibility to take care of him.

67
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,582
Please have the sweets.

68
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:47,468
Yes we will.

69
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:49,688
How long has Rahul’s sister been married?

70
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:50,339
2 years.

71
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:51,219
They are in Germany these days

72
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,219
They’ll reach here in time for the wedding .

73
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,700
Her wedding was a grand ceremony.

74
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,440
The celebrations went on for 5 days.

75
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,419
As you know, the marriage is borne by bride’s family.

76
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,099
So, we didn’t compromise on anything.

77
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:05,099
We gifted them 75 lakhs in money and a Benz car.

78
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,879
But, we won’t be asking you any dowry for his wedding.

79
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,579
We are sure you’ll do the needful.

80
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:11,199
Isn’t it?

81
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,699
Yes

82
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,559
Nobody should feel that he received any less than what was given to his sister.

83
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,999
Excuse me, I’ll be right back.

84
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:18,499
Manu,

85
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:19,639
will you please drop me.

86
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,159
My car away for servicing.

87
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,659
Oh yes,

88
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:22,899
I myself am about to leave. Let’s go

89
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:23,579
Hey Manu!

90
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,295
Did you hear..

91
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:25,235
that when Phase three opens,

92
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:27,655
there would be more than 5000 new job openings?

93
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:28,835
I’ve been trying to untangle this knot,

94
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:30,635
and along comes new one!

95
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:32,296
You look quite dull , Manu!

96
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:33,655
I’m tired of this job.

97
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:35,295
These deadlines and over -times!

98
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:36,860
There is practically no life here,

99
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,760
other than making some money.

100
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,640
Computers are eating away all the good days of my life.

101
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,740
You feel so because you are idle.

102
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,340
Weren’t you passionate about photography?

103
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,380
I haven’t seen your camera since long.

104
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,861
How can I click the camera,

105
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:50,421
when I don’t find time from clicking the mouse!

106
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,101
Earlier I was active in community services;

107
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:55,141
I used to teach kids.

108
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,181
Though it never earned me much money ,

109
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:59,081
it gave me a lot of happiness.

110
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:01,081
You can’t anticipate only happiness in life.

111
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,022
That’s true.

112
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:03,721
Else I would have left this job long back.

113
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:05,521
Everyone here is selfish.

114
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:08,021
They lack any sincerity or commitment towards others.

115
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,854
What meaning does it all have?

116
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:11,774
There is politics even in our office.

117
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,827
And, when we step out,

118
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:14,260
they discriminate based on caste, religion and such nonsense.

119
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,420
What’s wrong is this attitude.

120
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,860
Are you emulating  Dileep’s role in Kadhavaseshan ?

121
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,380
This is not something we can change.

122
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,220
This will change only if we make an effort!

123
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,360
This attitude has to change!

124
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Hey, Manu, lookout!

125
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,860
Manu… Manu, stop!

126
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,448
Why can’t you turn on the indicator before taking a turn?!

127
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:28,428
It’s not enough to just know how to drive,

128
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:29,508
you need some civic sense too!

129
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:30,908
Did I hit your car!

130
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:33,468
You were over speeding and now you are blaming me?

131
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:34,093
what happened?

132
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,293
He was over speeding and blaming me.

133
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:36,793
Me!?

134
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:37,416
Manu!

135
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,408
Manu! please come lets go!

136
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:39,908
Oh!

137
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:41,119
you have a chick in the car!

138
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:41,719
No wonder,

139
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,899
you didn’t see the auto and the people around

140
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:44,699
Manu No! Stop! Please!

141
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,699
Hey! Stop your show off here!

142
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,179
Girl, ask him to leave!

143
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,139
Take your car and leave!

144
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:51,139
They didn’t start the fight!

145
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:53,319
Something? Didn’t you hear what they said!?

146
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,358
This isn’t just frustration.

147
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:56,459
And if, god forbid,  they are turn out to be techies,

148
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,798
That’s why I said that the mentality of the society here has to change to make this place any better!

149
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:01,898
The world deserves to hear your reaction.

150
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:03,898
People need to understand

151
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:05,478
into the societies’ pulse.

152
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,878
and analyse it if it makes sense to you.

153
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:10,118
on TV all one hears about are news about ‘abuses’.

154
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:12,858
Who wouldn’t rape these women

155
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:16,078
These dresses don’t even cover them properly.

156
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:19,198
Don’t blame it on women’s dress.

157
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:22,838
If our maid comes here wearing a short skirt?

158
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:26,338
A 12 year old girl was raped in our locality.

159
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:28,778
Speak softly. He can hear us!

160
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:30,778
Aunty is Gautham here?

161
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:33,418
Gautham, your friends are here!

162
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:37,839
I wish to fly like a balloon

163
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,179
I will fly, because I am superman!

164
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,519
Girls die because of it.

165
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,299
Girls die?

166
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:44,839
girls are raped because they wear short dresses.

167
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,219
?Is my dress short?

168
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,459
You mean ‘peedanam’ ( abuse)?

169
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,459
I have heard that on TV.

170
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,138
Grandma, what is the meaning ‘peedanam’ ( abuse)?

171
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:53,138
I have told you several times

172
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:56,159
Mom said girls are raped when they turn 12.

173
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,919
No don’t. They might scold you.

174
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,559
I heard my dad asking my mom to talk softly

175
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,479
She would have told me if something happened.

176
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,699
What will we do if someone comes to rape Malu ?

177
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,279
Come, let’s go and play.

178
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,599
Why, are you scared to lose to the boys?

179
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:13,559
No! Boys are smart! You can’t beat us if 3 of us join together!

180
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:16,119
Boys are smart. We will protect you.

181
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:19,479
Now that I’m going to the States only to take care of Rahul,

182
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,111
But you don’t worry aunty,

183
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:23,075
I will take very good care of your son.

184
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:25,255
I’ll prepare pineapple pulissery (curry) for him.

185
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:27,615
But, I don’t want  to be paid 40000 rupees,

186
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:30,095
I should have atleast told her this much.

187
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:33,135
I don’t wish to join those who proclaim that

188
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:36,695
Kerala is losing its power to react,

189
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,675
Instead, I feel our responses are limited

190
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:43,375
I don’t want to join the majority who hide and react.

191
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,695
Most of the times the society tries to hold us down,

192
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:49,715
never letting us soar high.

193
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,715
which wants to free itself into the air.

194
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:53,535
It is high time we break free

195
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,015
We shouldn’t tie the future generation

196
00:05:57,015 --> 00:06:00,755
We should break all these ties which hold us back.
